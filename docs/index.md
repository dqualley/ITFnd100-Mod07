# Using Binary Files and Structured Error Handling
## In this program I demonstrate the use of binary files and structured error handling.
## Binary files. 
### Binary files are an alternative to text files in the Python programming language.
### While text files offer convenience because they are editable in a text editor, they are limited to storing a series of characters. Using binary files (.dat) allows the program to store more complex data in a file with a single line of code.
## Structured Error Handling
### Structured error handling is a method of handling errors so that the user receives customized error messages back rather than using the python-based error message. 
## Binary files are good alternatives to text files in Python for storing more complex data. Structured error handling allows the program to display custom error messages so the user does not have to read the python-generated error messages.
